<h2> My Original News Document </h2>
<p> Made on 2/3/24 was a document consisting of basic coding skill with a story wrapped in there about how I was always told to work with computers in some way. <br/>
I felt really good about this assignment, as it was all the effort from most of the reading material at that point all put together. <br/>
Until I only got a score of eighty % due to the code showing on the web page, I dont even know either how to change the code from not appearing on the webpage. <br/>
So now I will work even harder then before to complete this assignment, (and in general just hope it turns out well.) </p>
